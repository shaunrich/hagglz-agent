### Step 2: Connect Local Repository
```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/Platform45/hagglz-agent.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ðŸ”§ LangGraph Platform Deployment

### Step 3: Deploy to LangGraph Platform
1. Go to LangGraph Platform dashboard
2. Click "Create New Deployment"
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `hagglz-negotiation-agent`
   - **Git Branch**: `main`
   - **LangGraph API config file**: `langgraph.json`
   - **Repository**: `https://github.com/Platform45/hagglz-agent`
   - âœ… Check "Automatically update deployment on push to branch"

### Step 4: Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in the deployment:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your-langsmith-api-key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=hagglz-production
```

### Step 5: Choose Deployment Type
- **Development**: Use "Deployment (free)" for testing
- **Production**: Upgrade to "Production" for scaling

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-deployment.langchain.app/invoke" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {
      "bill_data": {
        "text": "ELECTRIC BILL - City Power Company - Amount Due: $124.58",
        "user_id": "test_user",
        "amount": 124.58
